# Sobel_From_Scratch
Implementation of sobel kernels from scratch 
This repository contains an implementation of the Sobel edge detection algorithm from scratch using Python. The Sobel operator is used to detect edges in an image by calculating the gradient of image intensity at each pixel. This implementation demonstrates the step-by-step process of applying the Sobel operator to a grayscale image
Implementation Steps are as follows -: 
1 -> Pre-allocate filtered_image Array with Zeros:
2 -> Edge Detection Code
 2.1 -> Loop through Image Pixels
 2.2 -> Calculate Gradients
 2.3 -> Compute Gradient Magnitude
3 -> Normalize Filtered Image
4 -> Display Filtered Image with different thresholds
